== Deployment Descriptors

This chapter describes the various deployment descriptors used for Web
Services for Java EE and the roles responsible for defining the
information within the deployment descriptors.

[#anchor-66]
=== Web Services Deployment Descriptor

This section defines the content of the webservices.xml file, location
within modules, roles and responsibilities, and the format.

==== Overview

The webservices.xml deployment descriptor file defines the set of Web
services that are to be deployed in a Web Services for Java EE enabled
container. With JAX-WS the use of webservices.xml is optional since the
annotations can be used to specify most of the information specified in
this deployment descriptor file. The deployment descriptors are only
used to override or augment the annotation member attributes. The
packaging of the webservices.xml deployment descriptor file is defined
in sections link:#anchor-55[5.4.2] and link:#anchor-56[5.4.3]. Web
services are defined by WSDL documents as described by section
link:#anchor-4[3.2]. The deployment descriptor defines the WSDL port to
Port component relationship. Port components are defined in Chapter
link:#anchor-35[5].

==== Developer responsibilities

The developer is responsible not only for the implementation of a Web
service, but also for declaring its deployment characteristics. The
deployment characteristics are defined in both the EJB annotations or
module specific deployment descriptor and Web Services annotations or
the webservices.xml deployment descriptor. Service Implementations using
a stateless or singleton session bean may use EJB annotations with no
deployment descriptor file. If the EJB annotations are not specified
then the stateless or singleton session bean must be defined in the
ejb-jar.xml deployment descriptor file using the session element.
Service Implementations using a JAX-RPC Service Endpoint must be defined
in the web.xml deployment descriptor file using the servlet-class
element. Servlet based web service endpoints using JAX-WS are not
required to provide the web.xml deployment descriptor file (see section
5.3.2.1). See the Enterprise JavaBeans and Servlet specifications for
additional details on developer requirements for defining deployment
descriptors. The developer is also required to provide structural
information that defines the Port components within the webservices.xml
deployment descriptor file. The developer is responsible for providing
the set of WSDL documents that describe the Web services to be deployed,
the Java classes that represent the Web services, and the mapping that
correlates the two.

The developer is responsible for providing the following information in
the webservices.xml deployment descriptor:

* **Port’s name. **A logical name for the port must be specified by the
developer using the port-component-name element. This name bears no
relationship to the WSDL port name. This name must be unique amongst all
port component names in a module.
* **Port’s bean class. **The developer declares the implementation of
the Web service using the service-impl-bean element of the deployment
descriptor. The bean declared in this element must refer to a class that
implements the methods of the Port’s Service Endpoint Interface. This
element allows a choice of implementations. For a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS
Service Endpoint, the servlet-link element associates the port-component
with a JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Endpoint class defined in the web.xml
by the servlet-class element. For a stateless or singleton session bean
implementation, the ejb-link element associates the port-component with
a session element in the ejb-jar.xml. The ejb-link element may not refer
to a session element defined in another module. A servlet must only be
linked to by a single port-component. A session EJB must only be linked
to by a single port-component.
* **Port’s Service Endpoint Interface. **The developer must specify the
fully qualified class name of the Service Endpoint Interface in the
service-endpoint-interface element. The Service Endpoint Interface
requirements may be found in section link:#anchor-42[5.3.1]. If the
Service Implementation is a stateless session EJB, the developer must
also specify the Service Endpoint Interface in the EJB deployment
descriptor using the service-endpoint element. See the Enterprise
JavaBeans 3.0 specification for more details.
* *Port’s WSDL definition.* The wsdl-file element specifies a location
of the WSDL description of a set of Web services. The location is
relative to the root of the module and must be specified by the
developer. The WSDL file may reference (e.g. import) other files
contained within the module using relative references. It may also
reference other files external to the module using an explicit URL.
Relative imports are declared relative to the file defining the import.
Imported files may import other files as well using relative locations
or explicit URLs. It is recommended that the WSDL file and relative
referenced files be packaged in the wsdl directory as described in
section link:#anchor-52[5.4.1]. Relative references must not start with
a “/”.
* **Service QName. **In addition to specifying the WSDL document, the
developer may also specify the WSDL Service QName in the wsdl-service
element for each Port defined in the deployment descriptor when JAX-WS
based runtime is used. This element is required if the port-component
being defined is a Provider Interface defined by JAX-WS.
* *Port’s QName.* In addition to specifying the WSDL document, the
developer must also specify the WSDL port QName in the wsdl-port element
for each Port defined in the deployment descriptor.
* **MTOM/XOP support. **The developer may specify if MTOM/XOP support
for the port-component is enabled or disabled by using enable-mtom
element when JAX-WS based runtime is used.
* **Addressing support. **The developer may specify an addressing
support for the port-component by using addressing element when JAX-WS
based runtime is used.
* **RespectBindingg support. **The developer may specify a respect
binding support for the port-component by using respect-binding element
when JAX-WS based runtime is used.
* **Protocol Binding. **The developer may override the protocol binding
specified by BindingType annotation by specifying the URI or a
pre-defined token (like ##SOAP11_HTTP, ##SOAP12_HTTP, ##XML_HTTP etc.)
in the protocol-binding element when JAX-WS based runtime is used. The
default protocol binding is ##SOAP11_HTTP. If this element is not
specified then the default value is assumed. The pre-defined tokens
essentially act as alias for the actual URI for the protocol binding.
The URIs for these pre-defined tokens are listed below:
* ##SOAP11_HTTP - "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/http"
* ##SOAP12_HTTP - "http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/"
* ##SOAP11_HTTP_MTOM -
"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/http?mtom=true"
* ##SOAP12_HTTP_MTOM –
"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap/bindings/HTTP/?mtom=true"
* ##XML_HTTP - "http://www.w3.org/2004/08/wsdl/http"
* *JAX-RPC Mapping.* The developer must specify the correlation of the
WSDL definition to the interfaces using the jaxrpc-mapping-file element.
This element is only required when JAX-RPC based runtime is used. Its
not required with JAX-WS and ignored if specified. The requirements for
specifying information in the jaxrpc-mapping-file are covered in section
link:#anchor-70[7.3]. The same mapping file must be used for all
interfaces associated with a wsdl-file.
* *Handlers.* A developer may optionally specify handlers associated
with the port-component using either the handler element when JAX-RPC
based runtime is used or the handler-chains element when JAX-WS based
runtime is used. With JAX-WS, the soap-header element declared in the
deployment descriptor is not required since that information is embedded
in the implementation of the Handler class. With JAX-WS, init-params
element in the deployment descriptors is no longer used. If needed, the
developer should use the environment entry elements (<env-entry>)
declared in the application component's deployment descriptor for this
purpose. These can be injected into the handler using the @Resource
annotation or looked up using JNDI.
* **Servlet Mapping. **A developer may optionally specify a
servlet-mapping, in the web.xml deployment descriptor, for a JAX-RPC or
JAX-WS Service Endpoint. No more than one servlet-mapping may be
specified for a servlet that is linked to by a port-component. The
url-pattern of the servlet-mapping must be an exact match pattern (i.e.
it must not contain an asterisk (“*”)).

Note that if the WSDL specifies an address statement within the port,
its URI address is ignored. This address is generated and replaced
during the deployment process in the deployed WSDL.

See also the developer requirements defined in section
link:#anchor-71[7.2.2].

==== Assembler responsibilities

The assembler’s responsibilities for Web Services for Java EE are an
extension of the assembler responsibilities as defined by the Enterprise
JavaBeans, Servlet, and Java EE specifications. The assembler creates a
deployable artifact by composing multiple modules, resolving
cross-module dependencies, providing annotation overrides and producing
an EAR file.

The assembler may modify any of the following information that has been
specified by the developer in the webservices.xml deployment descriptor
file:

* *Description fields.* The assembler may change existing or create new
description elements.
* *Handlers.* The assembler may change values of existing param-value
elements, may add new init-param elements, may change or add soap-header
elements with JAX-RPC, may change or add soap-role elements, or may add
new handler elements or new handler-chain elements. With JAX-WS, Handler
implementation must contain all the soap-header information needed by
it.

See also the assembler responsibilities defined in
sectionlink:#anchor-72[7.2.3].

==== Deployer responsibilities

The deployer responsibilities are defined by the Java EE, Enterprise
JavaBeans, and Servlet specifications.

In addition, the deployer must resolve the following information:

* where published WSDL definitions are placed. The deployer must publish
every webservice-description wsdl-file with the correct port address
attribute value to access the service.
* the value of the port address attribute for deployed services.

==== Web Services Deployment Descriptor XML Schema

The XML Schema for the Web service deployment descriptor is described at
http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/javaee_web_services_1_4.xsd

[#anchor-67]
=== Service Reference Deployment Descriptor Information

This section defines the function of the Service Reference XML schema
file, its use within modules, the platform roles and responsibilities
for defining instance data, and the format.

==== Overview

The Service Reference XML schema defines the schema for service
reference entries. These entries declare references to Web services used
by a Java EE component in the web, EJB, or application client container.
With JAX-WS, these entries are not required if
javax.xml.ws.WebServiceRef annotation is used. If the Web services
client is a Java EE component, then it uses a logical name for the Web
service called a service reference to look up the service. Any component
that uses a Web service reference must declare a dependency on the Web
service reference in a module’s deployment descriptor file.

[#anchor-71]
==== Developer responsibilities

The developer is responsible for defining a service-ref for each Web
service a component within the module wants to reference. This includes
the following information:

* **Service Reference Name. **This defines a logical name for the
reference that is used in the client source code. It is recommended, but
not required that the name begin with service/.
* *Service type:* The service-interface element defines the fully
qualified name of the JAX-RPC or JAX-WS Service Interface/Class class
returned by the JNDI lookup.
* *Service Reference type:* The service-ref-type element declares the
type of the service-ref element that is injected or returned when a JNDI
lookup is done. This must be either a fully qualified name of Service
class or the fully qualified name of Service endpoint interface class.
This is an optional element and used only with JAX-WS.
* *Ports.* The developer declares requirements for container managed
port resolution using the port-component-ref element. The
port-component-ref elements are resolved to a WSDL port by the
container. See Chapter link:#anchor-18[4] for a discussion of container
managed port access.
* *MTOM/XOP support.* The developer may specify if MTOM/XOP support for
the port-component-ref is enabled or disabled by using enable-mtom
element when JAX-WS based runtime is used.
* *Addressing support.* The developer may specify an addressing support
for the port-component-ref by using _addressing_ element when JAX-WS
based runtime is used.
* *RespectBinding support.* The developer may specify a respect binding
support for the _port-component-ref_ by using _respect-binding_ element
when JAX-WS based runtime is used.

The developer may specify the following information:

* [#anchor-73]##**WSDL definition.** The wsdl-file element specifies a
location of the WSDL description of the service. The location is
relative to the root of the module. The WSDL description may be a
partial WSDL, but must at least include the portType and binding
elements. The WSDL description provided by the developer is considered a
template that must be preserved by the assembly/deployment process. In
other words, the WSDL description contains a declaration of the
application’s dependency on portTypes, bindings, and QNames. The WSDL
document must be fully specified, including the service and port
elements, if the application is dependent on port QNames (e.g. uses the
Service.getPort(QName,Class) method). The developer must specify the
wsdl-file if any of the Service methods declared in section
link:#anchor-31[4.2.4.4] or link:#anchor-32[4.2.4.5] are used. The WSDL
file may reference (e.g. import) other files contained within the module
using relative references. It may also reference other files external to
the module using an explicit URL. Relative imports are declared relative
to the file defining the import. Imported files may import other files
as well using relative locations or explicit URLs. Relative references
must not start with a “/”.
* *Service Port.* If the specified wsdl-file has more than one service
element, the developer must specify the service-qname.
* **JAX-RPC Mapping. **The developer specifies the correlation of the
WSDL definition to the interfaces using the jaxrpc-mapping-file element.
This element is only required when JAX-RPC based runtime is used. Its
not required with JAX-WS. The location is relative to the root of the
module. The same mapping file must be used for all interfaces associated
with a wsdl-file. The developer must specify the jaxrpc-mapping-file if
the wsdl-file is specified.
* *Handlers.* A developer may optionally specify handlers associated
with the service-ref using the handler element when JAX-RPC based
runtime is used. The developer may optionally use the handler-chains
element when specifying handler chains associated with the service-ref
under JAX-WS based runtime.

[#anchor-72]
==== Assembler responsibilities

In addition to the responsibilities defined within the Java EE
specification, the assembler may define the following information:

* *Binding of service references*. The assembler may link a Web service
reference to a component within the Java EE application unit using the
port-component-link element. It is the assembler’s responsibility to
ensure there are no detailed differences in the SEI and target bindings
that would cause stub generation or runtime problems.

The assembler may modify any of the following information that has been
specified by the developer in the service-ref element of the module’s
deployment descriptor file:

* *Description fields.* The assembler may change existing or create new
description elements.
* *Handlers.* The assembler may change values of existing param-value
elements, may add new init-param elements, may change or add soap-header
elements with JAX-RPC, may change or add soap-role elements, or may add
new handler elements or new handler-chain elements. With JAX-WS, Handler
implementation must contain all the soap-header information needed by
it.
* *WSDL definition.* The assembler may replace the WSDL definition with
a new WSDL that resolves missing service and port elements or missing
port address attributes. The assembler may update the port address
attribute__.__

==== Deployer responsibilities

In addition to the normal duties a Java EE deployer platform role has,
the deployer must also provide deploy time binding information to
resolve the WSDL document to be used for each service-ref. If a partial
WSDL document was specified and service and port elements are needed by
a vendor to resolve the binding, they may be generated. The deployer is
also responsible for providing deploy time binding information to
resolve port access declared by the port-component-ref element.

[#section725]
==== Web Services Client Service Reference XML Schema

[#anchor-74]##This section defines the XML Schema for the service-ref at
http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/javaee_web_services_client_1_4.xsd.
This schema is imported into the common Java EE schema and is used by
the application client, web, and EJB module deployment descriptor
schemas to declare service-refs. See the Java EE 7 and corresponding
versions of Servlet and EJB specifications for more details on
specifying a service-ref in the deployment descriptors.

[#anchor-40]
=== JAX-RPC Mapping Deployment Descriptor

This section defines the content of the JAX-RPC mapping file, location
within modules, roles and responsibilities, and the format. It applies
only to JAX-RPC based runtime. This mapping file is not required in
JAX-WS since it uses JAXB specification for all its data binding needs.

==== Overview

The JAX-RPC mapping deployment descriptor has no standard file name,
though it is recommended that the file use a .xml suffix. There is a 1-1
correspondence between WSDL files and mapping files within a module. The
JAX-RPC mapping deployment descriptor contains information that
correlates the mapping between the Java interfaces and WSDL definition.
A deployment tool uses this information along with the WSDL file to
generate stubs and TIEs for the deployed services and service-refs.

==== Developer responsibilities

A developer creates the mapping file at the same time that the WSDL
and/or Java interfaces are created. A developer may specify only the
package-mapping if the following conditions are met:

* The WSDL file must contain exactly one service element.
* The service element must define exactly one port.
* The set of service name, binding name, portType name, and all root
WSDL type (e.g. complexType, simpleType, etc.) names must be unique.
* The port’s binding must be a soap 1.1 binding with style="rpc"; all
its operations must specify use="encoded", encodingStyle="_<the SOAP 1.1
encoding>_" for their input, output, and fault messages and either omit
the parts attribute or include it such that all the parts of both the
input and output message are mapped to the soap body. Also, no soap
headers or header faults can be specified in the binding.
* Each operation must:
* Have a unique name (in the context of the portType it belongs to) that
follows the Java conventions for method names.
* Have exactly one input message.
* Have at most one output message.
* Have zero or more fault messages.
* Either have no parameterOrder attribute or the value of that attribute
must be a complete listing of all parts in the input message in the
order they appear therein.
* Faults must map to an exception such that it:
* Directly or indirectly inherits from java.lang.Exception, but must not
inherit from RuntimeException nor RemoteException.
* Has at most a single property called “message” of type
java.lang.String with corresponding single String argument constructor.
* Must be SOAP encoded.
* Each input message may have 0 or more parts
* Each output message must have either 0 or 1 parts. If present, the
part must have a name different from that of any parts in the input
message.
* Each part must be of this form:

* <part name="..." type="_T_"/>

* Each type __T __must be one of the following valid types:
* A simple type defined in table 4-1, section 4.2.1 of the JAX-RPC
specification.
* A complex type using either the sequence compositor:

<xsd:complexType name="_T_">

____
<xsd:sequence>
____

<xsd:element name="..." type="_Tprime_"/>

____
</xsd:sequence>
____

</xsd:complexType>

* Or the all compositor:

<xsd:complexType name="_T_">

____
<xsd:all>
____

<xsd:element name="..." type="_Tprime_"/>

____
</xsd:all>
____

</xsd:complexType>

* In either case, the element declarations can appear one or more times
and each type _Tprime_ must be valid. All element names are mapped as
JavaBeans properties and element names follow the standard JavaBeans
property name convention of lower case for the first character and the
complexType name follows the Java standard class name conventions of
upper case first letter.

* A SOAP array of the form:

<xsd:complexType name="...">

____
<xsd:restriction base="soapenc:Array"/>
____

<xsd:attribute ref="soapenc:arrayType"

____
wsdl:arrayType="_Tprime_[]"/>
____

____
</xsd:restriction>
____

</xsd:complexType>

* where Tprime is a valid type and is not a SOAP array type.

If the conditions are not met, a full mapping must be specified. There
must be a java-xml-type-mapping for every global type definition that is
reachable from the port types (and its attributes like operations,
faults, messages etc.) in the WSDL file.. An exception-mapping must be
created for each WSDL fault. There must be a service-interface-mapping
for every service element in the WSDL file that has a Generated Service
Interface used by the developer. There must be a
service-endpoint-interface-mapping for every combination of portType and
binding in the WSDL file. There must be a package-mapping for every
namespace defined in the WSDL file.

Web Services for Java EE providers may support partial mapping
specifications (e.g. not providing a method-param-parts-mapping for
every method) regardless of the WSDL content by using standard JAX-RPC
WSDL to Java mapping rules to resolve the mappings. If mappings are
specified, they take precedence over the mapping rules. Applications
that use partial mappings are therefore non-portable.

For INOUT parameters, only the mapping for the input message is
required.

The developer must define the jaxrpc-mapping-file element of the
webservices.xml or module deployment descriptor (if a service-ref is
used) to be the location of the mapping file.

The developer must package the mapping file in the module with the WSDL
file.

===== Mapping xsd:any

Mapping for xsd:any is described by the JAX-RPC specification. JAX-RPC
defines this as a mapping to/from javax.xml.soap.SoapElement or an array
of type SoapElement.

===== Mapping anonymous types

Anonymous types require some special handling in order to provide a
mapping. Anonymous types have no QName, but dealing with mappings,
serializers, and deserializers becomes much easier if they are assigned
QNames. Anonymous types are treated as root WSDL types with special
QNames and are mapped using the java-xml-type-mapping. In order to
achieve some portability in determining what anonymous type a
java-xml-type-mapping refers to, the following rules must be used.

[arabic]
. For type T, the qname-scope is either complexType or simpleType
depending on the type of T and the localname of T is determined as
follows:

[loweralpha]
. If T has a name attribute, then its name is the value of the name
attribute and is entered as a root-type-qname.
. If T has no name attribute, then its name is “>E” where E is the name
of its enclosing element. The name is entered as an
_anonymous-type-qname_.

[arabic]
. For element E, the qname-scope is element and the localname of E is:

[loweralpha]
. If E is at the root level, then the name is “N” where N is the value
of the name attribute. The name is entered as a root-type-qname.
. If E is not at the root level, then the name “T>N” where T is the name
of the enclosing type and N is the value of the name attribute. The name
is entered as an anonymous-type-qname.

[arabic]
. [#anchor-75]##If element E has a maxOccurs attribute greater than 1,
then it also has a 'hidden' anonymous type called A. A is an array of
the enclosed type. The qname-scope of A is complexType and the name of A
is...

[loweralpha]
. If E has a name attribute, then the name of A is
"E[<minOccursValue>,<maxOccursValue>]" where E is the value of E’s name
attribute. The name is entered as an anonymous-type-qname.
. If E has no name attribute, then the name of A is
"R[<minOccursValue>,<maxOccursValue>]" where R is the name of the
referent element. The name is entered as an anonymous-type-qname.

* {blank}
+
____
In the interest of portability, vendors must accept both a null string
and a value of ‘1’ for <minOccursValue>. For example, E[,10] and E[1,10]
are equivalent names.
____

Note that only root level types and elements have a namespace, so all
anonymous types acquire their namespaces from the enclosing root level
element or type. An anonymous type QName is not a valid QName, therefore
the namespace should be fully specified rather than relying on XML
Schema namespace prefix resolution. This is the only supported form for
portability. In this case, the namespace is parsed to include all the
characters up to the right-most ‘:’ (colon). The right-most colon serves
as a delimiter between the namespace and localpart.

Hidden anonymous array types, as defined in rule
link:#anchor-75[7.3.2.2], are declared in a param-type element as the
name of the Java type of type T appended with “[]” if the mapping is to
a Java array. This is the only supported and portable mapping for hidden
anonymous array types at this time.

The following example will help illustrate anonymous types and their
mappings. Example name rule uses are underlined:

<schema … targetNamespace=”X”>

<__complexType__^_1_^ name=”root”>

<sequence>

<element name="data" type="string" />

</sequence>

</complexType>

<__element__^_2_^ name="root" __minOccurs="0"
maxOccurs="unbounded"__^_3_^>

<__complexType__^_4_^>

<sequence>

<__element__^_5_^ name="inside" __maxOccurs="10"__^_6_^>

<__complexType__^_7_^>

<sequence>

<element name="data2" type="string" />

</sequence>

</complexType>

</element>

<element ref="someOtherElement" __maxOccurs="20"__^_8_^/>

</sequence>

</complexType>

</element>

<__ element__^_9_^ name=”someOtherElement” type=”xsd:int”>

There are 9 named types. Their names are defined as:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|Use case |Rule based name |Based on rule
|1 |X:root |Rule 1.a
|2 |X:root |Rule 2.a
|3 |X:root[0,unbounded] |^_2_^ and rule 3.a
|4 |X:>root |^_2_^ and rule 1.b
|5 |X:>root>inside |^_4_^ and rule 2.b
|6 |X:>root>inside[,10] |^_5_^ and rule 3.a
|7 |X:>>root>inside |^_5_^ and rule 1.b
|8 |X:someOtherElement[,20] |^_9_^ and rule 3.b
|9 |X:someOtherElement |Rule 2.a
|===

Given the above use case, an example mapping file fragment would look
like:

===== Mapping multiple output params

The mapping for OUT and IN/OUT parameters must be the Java class-type
representation of the WSDL type. This is true even when multiple OUT or
IN/OUT parts exist within a WSDL message. In this case, the Holder type
is inferred based on the specified class-type.

==== Assembler responsibilities

The assembler must not change the JAX-RPC Mapping file.

==== Deployer responsibilities

The deployer uses deployment tools to deploy the services and
service-refs contained inside a module. The deployment tool must use the
JAX-RPC mapping file to generate stubs and TIEs for the services and
service-refs.

==== JAX-RPC Mapping Schema

This XML Schema for the JAX-RPC mapping files is described at
http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/j2ee/j2ee_jaxrpc_mapping_1_1.xsd
